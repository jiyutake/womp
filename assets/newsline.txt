⁠# Hi, this is the news ticker file. You probably don't want to read this to not spoil yourself, but if you don't like waiting for the next one or got too many repeating stuff, go ahead. Wait, if it starts with an "⁠#" it does not appear on the ticker right? AAAAAAHH GET ME OUT OF THIS WIDGET!!
What exactly is a news ticker? Some phrase that scrolls through the screen, she said.
How many time do you have to productive today? Aparently, a new update on the famous wayland compositor [REDACTED] added to minimize productivity: slooooooow animations.

talk about ricing stuffs - this channel is not for distro discussions, please use ⁠#software for that.
“I am really excited for their new upcoming rice!” said nobody on the r/Unixporn official Discord server to one of it’s developers.
I am just writing whatever comes to mind at this point, i hope you news reader don’t mind it.
KIDS THESE DAYS DONT KNOW HOW TO RICE PROPERLY, ALL THEY KNOW IS 1. STEAL CODE 2. ASK THE GIPIDDY 3. ASK FOR HELP (edited) - [deniably] fake Gamer (🫃)
why do peopl mke their bar transparent?
I’d make a mockup or something to help but my “E-waste” (according to [REDACTED]) can’t run figma.
BREAKING: Allegedly, most users that use a certain wayland compositor fall into the paradox of choice because of choice overload. Do not ask them to remove one visual or functional feature as that might trigger an spontaneous anger reaction, screaming, and other unwanted outcomes.
No I'm not shrodinger's cat, though I may be. You have to bash my head against a rock to find out
my ass must be enchanted with fire aspect because it fucking burns🔥🔥🔥
My expectations are low, but they can always go lower.
Quitting! It's like trying, but easier!
The risk I took was calculated but man am I bad at math.
If you're gonna do something stupid be smart about it.
A rice becomes shit after you post it for the second time.
This is not perfect, but at least it is usable, right? 1 GNU C Library update later...

Today my procrastination menu is so nice! I have a lot of options including but not limited to: Procrastinating writing this very news you are currently reading, procrastinating on polishing this rice's designs, procrastinating on studying, procrastinating on reading books, procrastinating on practicing typing, procrastinating on making the worse code ever to commit and give failed an heada- my computer advised me not to continue writing this to not slow down your Womp(tm) experience. If you want to continue reading the hottest news, type 1. For help, type 2. If you are confused, press 1tg35p5p8ug. If you are experiencing an display manager freeze with an touch of no input detection, don't press anything and reboot your computer immediately. Alternatively, downgrade your GNU C Library version. Not that it guarantees that you will not get errors because of versioning. This also does not mean you will be able to even boot your computer, even. Is this long enough? Are you fond of this message? Do you even know how to call such "messages"? I've decided this(didn't) and previously discussed(doing it right now) that since the feature itself is called "News Ticker", it would be fair to call this either "Newses" or "Tickers", but i am not sure on what to call it... On the next episode of absolute slop writing (100% human writing, by the way) have a feast of misinformation with a "funny quotes" sauce and a seasoning of "meta-jokes about the r/Unixporn official Discord server" See you there!
Oh my god can you jump at the line 20 of newsline.txt? what the absolute nightmare is that message. who thought it was a good idea to write something this big?? Is it even supported by the widget to scroll this far? Someone has to get it though, and that is going to be YOU! Good luck going through all of that text.
smiley face!! :)
Whoever is reading this, you have to uninstall hyprland in the next 24 hours, or your rice carreer will be ruined forever.
All of this meta-joking it and no one has talked about The Game yet? Surprising.

Hii moderators! I would like to clarify that this post does not break any of the server rules, nor does it break the Discord platform's Terms of Services.
Is this feature force-feeding its users with dopamine? Shocking if true. Beware.
Could i uhh ummm could i get a heart emoji in this rice please chat...

Mods, give this two ricers a certain role with a rainbow star on it.
Failed watching in horror as Kate spends the hour writing 33 more news tickers rather than polishing the rice design
I'm built different (like incorrectly I think)
Why can't I resize receptacles nodes??? Is bspwm stupid???

ricing is a journey, and the destination is gnome
Sorry but gnome felt so bad the first time i used it that me, in a fresh opensuse tumbleweed install, imediatelly went back to installing arch. I'm sorry gnome lovers.
Ricing is a journey, and the destination.. Wait.. Wasn't the original news written by Failed? and didn't it have an basic grammar error?
BREAKING: User makes a bad rice in Gnome and a bad rice in Hyprland with the caption "Would you rather". Now the real question: would you rather use which of those? More on that after the message from our sponsors.
BREAKING: Two unemployed hyprland users are crashing out on #ricing-theming because they are arguing on who has the most mediocre rice. Please don't sue us thanks.
To be less mean through the use of euphemisms. Consider adding it to your decision making when communicating, so you don't end up saying "sorry but your rice looks ass" and instead say "hey, i do not think this rice is that bad considering you're not that old on the community, but consider changing this things i notice and am going to nitpick: the contrast between colors feels a bit bad because of the wallpaper that was made with the purpose to just match strictly the colors with the colorscheme instead of having more colors in between, and that by itself is sure an advance in technology to have someone change a wallpaper with hundreds, even thousands of colors to just sixteen, but that really, with no much other words for this, ruins the contrast between the bar, windows, widgets and everything else because the wallpaper uses the same color as the background, border, accent, you name it. You also didn't do that great of a job when it comes to layout. Being fair with you, desktop environments are great for normal usage, but you, on this server, will see tons and tons of creative ways of writing your own widgets and making them look pretty in a unique way, even if you copy an layout idea from someone. Yes you can probably have vertical bars and those fancy things on the Gnome desktop, but it will not look pleasing nor unique if you don't tweak the style of the elements and its positioning to look unique. I have more things to say about it that are subjectively making your rice less appealing, but you are free to disagree with my points if you understand that my intent is not negative when i deliever you this messages and points i think needed more attention on your rice. If you haven't given widgets a try, consider elkowar's wacky widgets, aylur's gnome shell, and the lots of other widgeting systems that the linux community offers you. With that said, i hope you have a pleasing time customizing your desktop and i also hope you test new software to not be stuck and bored with your rice, but also so you can test different software."
A widget is an heavily underused part of a rice that really adds up on the design, but can be something hard to do fovor a beginner compared to other software specifically made for bars, application launchers, power menus, notifications and others that can limit you on what you could do. But.. Who asked?
Oooooooo you wll see th egramar errrs ooooooooo o you braiin wil not iggnore teh errosr....... coep
Thank you for the girls that made it into the "Unixporn Star" role. And to Failed.. Congratulations i guess. (lightheartedly)
Guess who is writing more tickers instead of completing the merge? Haha! I love the mention of vivi and Colgate and gnome and Kate i guess.. Wait. Isn't that me?! MOM!!! I'M FAMOUS!!!!!
The urge to write something more schizo than the ticker #21 daily try not to do it(impossible)
Do you also have a Discord group Direct Message that has been abandoned for months or even years? I do too, and it is painful to see. Some people just are left alone i guess.

How to make big news tutorial like subscribe. step 1: add "BREAKING:". step two: why does step two is not "step 2"? step 3: say a irrelevant occurence. Example: "BREAKING: A certain user on the official r/Unixporn Discord server talks bad on an specific artist due to their music genre being different and outside of the user's music taste. Mentioned user was also being unsensitive about third's opinions quote: 'are you schizophrenic'; 'stay mad'; 'dont care'; 'womp womp'. Unfortunately, the last quote this user said is a direct reference to the to-be-famous project 'Womp', made by two very talented and prominent users on the Discord community, so both of them decided to rename the project to a new name: 'Hyprpiné'."
The above news has a total of 725 characters. That's 7.25e+2!
I know i can talk good about the r/unixporn discord server but if you want a good experience there you should mute and remove the following channels from your channel list: #lounge, #server-feedback, #off-topic, #announcements and any channel other than #ricing-theming and #showcase.
Wait for me to write the next bible having a crashout talking about all the commonly spotted bad design ideas and software limitations given by modern window manager and desktop environments.
I need to find a ricer to sanity check my rices.
Your rices have failed successfully the test.
smots gaming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Time to quote people that once were part of the community that wrote really cool messages. Who said this?
Remember to `womp theme rosepine_dawn` before committing so you don't change 31 files that will confuse anyone looking on the change history.
Do any of you reading this know a plugin for neovim similar to *insert subway surfers vscode plugin link*

Just be original! Most pre-made themes will suck because of the fact that you haven't made it yourself, so it is not perfect for your case. People will say Windows is perfect for their usage, but those same people haven't got out of their confort zone once, nor have an idea on what is waiting them outside of the confort zone. That is, chances to change and become a better version for yourself, or just some program that runs 2% more efficiently and software that is not really compatible with whatever you're using.
manjarno.snorlax.sh is a nice read. Specifically if you're really bored or don't have anything important to do.

I love the result of spending every second with designing this.
Honestly, i do not know how someone has not come up with a functional window manager for X11 that can be configured through only using cascading style sheets.
From the short experience on this server it is not exactly the most enlightening thing to hear that people will constantly change the topic of the Discord server's #ricing-theming channel to something completely unrelated from the point of the server on the first place.
You might be the cleanest Linux user ever. Keep taking that bath, always go for it.
I never call a release of software "bloat" per se, but i must admit that an specific animal-named terminal feels overly featured with pointless things that kill the performance and, even worse, refuses to add features because of bias.
Come on, why some software developers have to be biased on their projects? Seriously, this is an actual problem to be adressed by an important person on the Linux space. You see those people coding some new thing like an wayland compositor based on wlroots that just has the most anti-features ever made, and people will still use that just for the fact it is a Wayland compositor, or they like what they saw on a video using such software. Thinking the beauty of having as many options as you have on Linux for software wasn't a mistake at all, but i see plenty other people falling for the false option of choosing something often just being manipulated through either popularity or bias. If an specific terminal emulator, browser, or any software is the most popular, it really, and i truly mean it, not the best. You can have an really limited piece of software that is not that complex or time saving but people will still waste their time going on the "hype train" of just following whatever is the meta, which should not be a common thing on the space, specially considering how much different software and operating systems in general there are out there on the internet.

That's relatable, actually. You probably haven't read what i'm talking about because you didn't have the notifications open on your screen when the previous ticker was passing by. How do i know that? Well, a lot of luck and some attempts of making this sound cooler than it looks to me writing this on my poor keyboard looking it through my poor monitor.
