‚Å†# Hi, this is the news ticker file. You probably don't want to read this to not spoil yourself, but if you don't like waiting for the next one or got too many repeating stuff, go ahead. Wait, if it starts with an "‚Å†#" it does not appear on the ticker right? AAAAAAHH GET ME OUT OF THIS WIDGET!!
What exactly is a news ticker? Some phrase that scrolls through the screen, she said.
How many time do you have to productive today? Aparently, a new update on the famous wayland compositor [REDACTED] added to minimize productivity: slooooooow animations.
‚Äúhi hello hello h‚Äù - Zooter
talk about ricing stuffs - this channel is not for distro discussions, please use ‚Å†#software for that.
‚ÄúI am really excited for their new upcoming rice!‚Äù said nobody on the r/Unixporn official Discord server to one of it‚Äôs developers.
I am just writing whatever comes to mind at this point, i hope you news reader don‚Äôt mind it.
KIDS THESE DAYS DONT KNOW HOW TO RICE PROPERLY, ALL THEY KNOW IS 1. STEAL CODE 2. ASK THE GIPIDDY 3. ASK FOR HELP (edited) - [deniably] fake Gamer (ü´É)
why do peopl mke their bar transparent?
I‚Äôd make a mockup or something to help but my ‚ÄúE-waste‚Äù (according to [REDACTED]) can‚Äôt run figma.
BREAKING: Allegedly, most users that use a certain wayland compositor fall into the paradox of choice because of choice overload. Do not ask them to remove one visual or functional feature as that might trigger an spontaneous anger reaction, screaming, and other unwanted outcomes.
No I'm not shrodinger's cat, though I may be. You have to bash my head against a rock to find out
my ass must be enchanted with fire aspect because it fucking burns
My expectations are low, but they can always go lower.
Quitting! It's like trying, but easier!
The risk I took was calculated but man am I bad at math.
If you're gonna do something stupid be smart about it.
A rice becomes shit after you post it for the second time.
This is not perfect, but at least it is usable, right? 1 GNU C Library update later...
What is the chance to get the same message twice?                          What is the chance to get the same me- GET FOOLED HAAHAHAHA
Today my procrastination menu is so nice! I have a lot of options including but not limited to: Procrastinating writing this very news you are currently reading, procrastinating on polishing this rice's designs, procrastinating on studying, procrastinating on reading books, procrastinating on practicing typing, procrastinating on making the worse code ever to commit and give failed an heada- my computer advised me not to continue writing this to not slow down your Womp(tm) experience. If you want to continue reading the hottest news, type 1. For help, type 2. If you are confused, press 1tg35p5p8ug. If you are experiencing an display manager freeze with an touch of no input detection, don't press anything and reboot your computer immediately. Alternatively, downgrade your GNU C Library version. Not that it guarantees that you will not get errors because of versioning. This also does not mean you will be able to even boot your computer, even. Is this long enough? Are you fond of this message? Do you even know how to call such "messages"? I've decided this(didn't) and previously discussed(doing it right now) that since the feature itself is called "News Ticker", it would be fair to call this either "Newses" or "Tickers", but i am not sure on what to call it... On the next episode of absolute slop writing (100% human writing, by the way) have a feast of misinformation with a "funny quotes" sauce and a seasoning of "meta-jokes about the r/Unixporn official Discord server" See you there!
Oh my god can you jump at the line 20 of newsline.txt? what the absolute nightmare is that message. who thought it was a good idea to write something this big?? Is it even supported by the widget to scroll this far? Someone has to get it though, and that is going to be YOU! Good luck going through all of that text.
smiley face!! :)
Whoever is reading this, you have to uninstall hyprland in the next 24 hours, or your rice carreer will be ruined forever.
All of this meta-joking it and no one has talked about The Game yet? Surprising.

Hii moderators! I would like to clarify that this post does not break any of the server rules, nor does it break the Discord platform's Terms of Services.
Is this feature force-feeding its users with dopamine? Shocking if true. Beware.
Could i uhh ummm could i get a heart emoji in this rice please chat...

I was going to write something but let keep this so called news safe for everyone right? Anxious people shivering their timbers right now about it..
"Is this enough news or do i have to write more for you to free me?" -Person on my basement, several times.
No, a collective of two (2) users will not be able to simply write two thousand and five hundred unique news, but we silently agreed to not use AI generated content on the text, so have this short but guaranteed glorious slop.

Vim stands for Vi IMproved. Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, but only through the help of many others. See credits. Do the Vim tutor, a 30-minute interactive course for the basic commands, see :vimtutor. Read the user manual from start to end: :help usr_01.txt. For searching for help, type "help <word>:", then hit C d to see matching help entries for <word>. Oh i'm sorry, this is not Emacs, i meant CTRL-d.

This "News ticker" thing is really stable and will not interrupt abruptly any of i
Nix be like: {html = {div = {h1 = {text = "title"; class = "header-one pre-paragraph text-big text-bold"} div.div.li.text = "list"; div.div.li.class = "text-regular text-font-paragraph-width"}}}

So... How am i supposed to fix this "GNU C Library" issue?
Mods, give this two ricers a certain role with a rainbow star on it.
Failed watching in horror as Kate spends the hour writing 33 more news tickers rather than polishing the rice design
I'm built different (like incorrectly I think)
Why can't I resize receptacles nodes??? Is bspwm stupid???
The most underrated prime number is 7, and you can't convince me otherwise
