⁠# Hi, this is the news ticker file. You probably don't want to read this to not spoil yourself, but if you don't like waiting for the next one or got too many repeating stuff, go ahead. Wait, if it starts with an "⁠#" it does not appear on the ticker right? AAAAAAHH GET ME OUT OF THIS WIDGET!!
What exactly is a news ticker? Some phrase that scrolls through the screen, she said.
How many time do you have to productive today? Aparently, a new update on the famous wayland compositor [REDACTED] added to minimize productivity: slooooooow animations.

talk about ricing stuffs - this channel is not for distro discussions, please use ⁠#software for that.
“I am really excited for their new upcoming rice!” said nobody on the r/Unixporn official Discord server to one of it’s developers.
I am just writing whatever comes to mind at this point, i hope you news reader don’t mind it.
KIDS THESE DAYS DONT KNOW HOW TO RICE PROPERLY, ALL THEY KNOW IS 1. STEAL CODE 2. ASK THE GIPIDDY 3. ASK FOR HELP (edited) - [deniably] fake Gamer (🫃)
why do peopl mke their bar transparent?
I’d make a mockup or something to help but my “E-waste” (according to [REDACTED]) can’t run figma.
BREAKING: Allegedly, most users that use a certain wayland compositor fall into the paradox of choice because of choice overload. Do not ask them to remove one visual or functional feature as that might trigger an spontaneous anger reaction, screaming, and other unwanted outcomes.
No I'm not shrodinger's cat, though I may be. You have to bash my head against a rock to find out
my ass must be enchanted with fire aspect because it fucking burns🔥🔥🔥
My expectations are low, but they can always go lower.
Quitting! It's like trying, but easier!
The risk I took was calculated but man am I bad at math.
If you're gonna do something stupid be smart about it.
A rice becomes shit after you post it for the second time.
This is not perfect, but at least it is usable, right? 1 GNU C Library update later...
What is the chance to get the same message twice?                          What is the chance to get the same me- GET FOOLED HAAHAHAHA
Today my procrastination menu is so nice! I have a lot of options including but not limited to: Procrastinating writing this very news you are currently reading, procrastinating on polishing this rice's designs, procrastinating on studying, procrastinating on reading books, procrastinating on practicing typing, procrastinating on making the worse code ever to commit and give failed an heada- my computer advised me not to continue writing this to not slow down your Womp(tm) experience. If you want to continue reading the hottest news, type 1. For help, type 2. If you are confused, press 1tg35p5p8ug. If you are experiencing an display manager freeze with an touch of no input detection, don't press anything and reboot your computer immediately. Alternatively, downgrade your GNU C Library version. Not that it guarantees that you will not get errors because of versioning. This also does not mean you will be able to even boot your computer, even. Is this long enough? Are you fond of this message? Do you even know how to call such "messages"? I've decided this(didn't) and previously discussed(doing it right now) that since the feature itself is called "News Ticker", it would be fair to call this either "Newses" or "Tickers", but i am not sure on what to call it... On the next episode of absolute slop writing (100% human writing, by the way) have a feast of misinformation with a "funny quotes" sauce and a seasoning of "meta-jokes about the r/Unixporn official Discord server" See you there!
Oh my god can you jump at the line 20 of newsline.txt? what the absolute nightmare is that message. who thought it was a good idea to write something this big?? Is it even supported by the widget to scroll this far? Someone has to get it though, and that is going to be YOU! Good luck going through all of that text.
smiley face!! :)
Whoever is reading this, you have to uninstall hyprland in the next 24 hours, or your rice carreer will be ruined forever.
All of this meta-joking it and no one has talked about The Game yet? Surprising.

Hii moderators! I would like to clarify that this post does not break any of the server rules, nor does it break the Discord platform's Terms of Services.
Is this feature force-feeding its users with dopamine? Shocking if true. Beware.
Could i uhh ummm could i get a heart emoji in this rice please chat...

I was going to write something but let keep this so called news safe for everyone right? Anxious people shivering their timbers right now about it..

No, a collective of two (2) users will not be able to simply write two thousand and five hundred unique news, but we silently agreed to not use AI generated content on the text, so have this short but guaranteed glorious slop.

So... How am i supposed to fix this "GNU C Library" issue?
Mods, give this two ricers a certain role with a rainbow star on it.
Failed watching in horror as Kate spends the hour writing 33 more news tickers rather than polishing the rice design
I'm built different (like incorrectly I think)
Why can't I resize receptacles nodes??? Is bspwm stupid???
The most underrated prime number is 7, and you can't convince me otherwise

ricing is a journey, and the destination is gnome
Sorry but gnome felt so bad the first time i used it that me, in a fresh opensuse tumbleweed install, imediatelly went back to installing arch. I'm sorry gnome lovers.
Ricing is a journey, and the destination.. Wait.. Wasn't the original news written by Failed? and didn't it have an basic grammar error?
BREAKING: User makes a bad rice in Gnome and a bad rice in Hyprland with the caption "Would you rather". Now the real question: would you rather use which of those? More on that after the message from our sponsors.
BREAKING: Two unemployed hyprland users are crashing out on #ricing-theming because they are arguing on who has the most mediocre rice. Please don't sue us thanks.
To be less mean through the use of euphemisms. Consider adding it to your decision making when communicating, so you don't end up saying "sorry but your rice looks ass" and instead say "hey, i do not think this rice is that bad considering you're not that old on the community, but consider changing this things i notice and am going to nitpick: the contrast between colors feels a bit bad because of the wallpaper that was made with the purpose to just match strictly the colors with the colorscheme instead of having more colors in between, and that by itself is sure an advance in technology to have someone change a wallpaper with hundreds, even thousands of colors to just sixteen, but that really, with no much other words for this, ruins the contrast between the bar, windows, widgets and everything else because the wallpaper uses the same color as the background, border, accent, you name it. You also didn't do that great of a job when it comes to layout. Being fair with you, desktop environments are great for normal usage, but you, on this server, will see tons and tons of creative ways of writing your own widgets and making them look pretty in a unique way, even if you copy an layout idea from someone. Yes you can probably have vertical bars and those fancy things on the Gnome desktop, but it will not look pleasing nor unique if you don't tweak the style of the elements and its positioning to look unique. I have more things to say about it that are subjectively making your rice less appealing, but you are free to disagree with my points if you understand that my intent is not negative when i deliever you this messages and points i think needed more attention on your rice. If you haven't given widgets a try, consider elkowar's wacky widgets, aylur's gnome shell, and the lots of other widgeting systems that the linux community offers you. With that said, i hope you have a pleasing time customizing your desktop and i also hope you test new software to not be stuck and bored with your rice, but also so you can test different software."
A widget is an heavily underused part of a rice that really adds up on the design, but can be something hard to do fovor a beginner compared to other software specifically made for bars, application launchers, power menus, notifications and others that can limit you on what you could do. But.. Who asked?
Oooooooo you wll see th egramar errrs ooooooooo o you braiin wil not iggnore teh errosr....... coep
Thank you for the girls that made it into the "Unixporn Star" role. And to Failed.. Congratulations i guess. (lightheartedly)
Guess who is writing more tickers instead of completing the merge? Haha! I love the mention of vivi and Colgate and gnome and Kate i guess.. Wait. Isn't that me?! MOM!!! I'M FAMOUS!!!!!
The urge to write something more schizo than the ticker #21 daily try not to do it(impossible)
Do you also have a Discord group Direct Message that has been abandoned for months or even years? I do too, and it is painful to see. Some people just are left alone i guess.
Holy 💩 fucking shit 🎅 I 😩🙋 just 👏👌 realized 💡 why 😸 ricing feels 😁 so fucking soulless in 🕺 the age 👵 of hyprland and those 😩 half-assed 😩 compositors, it's because 😤 nobody 🙅🚫 gives a fuck 🙋 to decent👌 color 🔵🎨 schemes or basic design guidelines anymore... 💔 Gone 🏃 are the days 🌞 of base16 or even 😷🕚 base8, now 🕔 everything 😱 is catppuccin 💔🙅🚫 pywal 💔💔 (or whatever 😈 derivative is the current 💔💰 meta) with poorly 😱 recolored wallpapers. 🙅😱😱 People 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 don't 🙅 care 💅 about 😶 color 🏳️‍🌈 balance ⚖ or variety anymore, 😫😵 that's 🎆 why 🚮😢🤔 everything 🙌 looks 👀 so samey and why ⚠️ it feels 😓 like ☘️ there's 😎 a "hyprland aesthetic" -- it's transparency+blur with a wallpaper and colorscheme that 🌸 have 🤖 no 🙅❗ variety; they're 👨 almost 😮😦 entirely 👐👐 monochrome ⬜ or otherwise 😎 poorly created 🔨🎨 by 🍭😈 a program 📺 rather 👉 than 😻 someone 😒 with an actual 😤 eye 👀 On 🔛 top 🎩 of this, I ✅ think 🤔💭 another 🤒 major part 👏 is how 🤷👉 people 👮🏼‍♂️ don't 🚫 respect 🤬♀️ pairing wallpapers and color 🏳️‍🌈 schemes anymore. 🔥 It's always 🧢 premade wallpapers to match 🤷👉 the theme (catppuccin/gruvbox), wallpapers recolored by 🔥 a program 📺 to match 🤷👉 the theme (aster or equivalent), or themes created 🔨🎨 by 🔥😈 a program 📺 to match 🤷👉 the wallpaper (pywal or equivalent).
